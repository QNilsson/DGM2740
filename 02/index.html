          Mom… after all these years, God's not going to take a call from you. I
          don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes
          a diet is the best defense. We have unlimited juice? This party is
          going to be off the hook. Hey, Dad. Look at you. You're a year
          older…and a year closer to death. Buster: Oh yeah, I guess that's kind
          of funny. I'm in Vegas this week and would like to point out the Blue
          Man Group is *actually* hiring. The support group? Oh, yeah, the
          $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in
          3 months. Come on! They're not gonna strip, right? I told them not to,
          but I can't guarantee their instincts won't kick in.

          They don't appreciate him. It's his glasses… t hey make him look like
          a lizard. Plus he's self-conscious. The only thing more terrifying
          than the escaped lunatic's hook was his twisted call… Hey campers!
          Can't a guy call his mother pretty without it seeming strange? Amen.
          And how about that little piece of tail on her? Cute! I deceived you,
          mom. Tricked makes it sound like we have a playful relationship.
          Michael, you are not quite the ladies man I had pictured. Hopefully,
          we will remedy that when we are in the spa spreading body chocolate on
          each other. That's so you can videotape it when they put you in a
          naked pyramid and point to your Charlie Browns. T his is the best free
          scrapbooking class I've ever taken! Teamocil.
