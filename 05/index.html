        Patrick! you forgot how to eat again! come on, we'll get the funnel.
        oh well, i guess i'm not wearing any pants today! did you hear about
        the goldfish that went bankrupted? now he's a bronzefish. that's it
        mister! you just lost your brain privileges! plankton: 1% evil, 99%
        hot gas. sponge, i'm a big man. a big, big man! oh! i didn't realize
        it was happy hopping moron day! oh my god! a floating shopping list!
        ahhh! ... pants ripped off. huh? someone call the police, there's a
        pants thief on the loose did i patrick? did i? or did your criminal
        mind hypnotize me to steal it? y'all better apologize, or i'll be on
        you like ugly on an ape. we shall never deny a guest even the most
        ridiculous request. there once was a man from peru who dreamed he was
        eating his shoe. he woke with fright in the middle of the night, to
        find that his dream had come true! seaweed: 50% sea, 50% weed. put
        those eyeballs back in your head, son! my ice cream! it's alive!
        aaaahhhhhhh! holographic meatloaf? my favorite! attention all
        employees! just giving you a heads-up. i'll be conducting a surprise
        uniform inspection in one hour. whoever doesn't pass gets the boot. go
        out and get yourself a case of the krabbies. it's okay, spongebob! you
        can cheat! cheat that way!. That's it mister! you just lost your brain
        priviliges! squidward... i used your clarinet to unclog my toilet!
        squidward, you're steaming. you're like a steamed vegetable, only
        smarter. the inner machinations of my mind are an enigma. did you hear
        about the goldfish that went bankrupted? now he's a bronzefish. ...
        pants ripped off. huh? someone call the police, there's a pants thief
        on the loose soap... soap... what is soap? there once was a man from
        peru who dreamed he was eating his shoe. he woke with fright in the
        middle of the night, to find that his dream had come true! now you
        must develop a taste for free-form jazz we don't really have these
        powers! the powers are in the costumes. why else would we wear
        underwear over our pants? squidward, your ceiling is talking to me.
        we'd better do what he says... he knows how to grow food. my ice
        cream! it's alive! aaaahhhhhhh! they don't call me cheeks for nothing.
        but first, i'll need a garden hose and a flatbed truck and i'll need
        to remove your trousers. did you order twenty cases of... ripped
        pants?!.
