          hot gas. sponge, i'm a big man. a big, big man! oh! i didn't realize
          it was happy hopping moron day! oh my god! a floating shopping list!
          ahhh! ... pants ripped off. huh? someone call the police, there's a
          pants thief on the loose did i patrick? did i? or did your criminal
          mind hypnotize me to steal it? y'all better apologize, or i'll be on
          you like ugly on an ape. we shall never deny a guest even the most
          ridiculous request. there once was a man from peru who dreamed he was
          eating his shoe. he woke with fright in the middle of the night, to
          find that his dream had come true! seaweed: 50% sea, 50% weed. put
          those eyeballs back in your head, son! my ice cream! it's alive!
          aaaahhhhhhh! holographic meatloaf? my favorite! attention all
          employees! just giving you a heads-up. i'll be conducting a surprise
          uniform inspection in one hour. whoever doesn't pass gets the boot. go
          out and get yourself a case of the krabbies. it's okay, spongebob! you
          can cheat! cheat that way!. That's it mister! you just lost your brain
          priviliges! squidward... i used your clarinet to unclog my toilet!
          squidward, you're steaming. you're like a steamed vegetable, only
          smarter. the inner machinations of my mind are an enigma. did you hear
          about the goldfish that went bankrupted? now he's a bronzefish. ...
          pants ripped off. huh? someone call the police, there's a pants thief
          on the loose soap... soap... what is soap? there once was a man from
          peru who dreamed he was eating his shoe. he woke with fright in the
          middle of the night, to find that his dream had come true! now you
          must develop a taste for free-form jazz we don't really have these
          powers! the powers are in the costumes. why else would we wear
          underwear over our pants? squidward, your ceiling is talking to me.
          we'd better do what he says... he knows how to grow food. my ice
          cream! it's alive! aaaahhhhhhh! they don't call me cheeks for nothing.
          but first, i'll need a garden hose and a flatbed truck and i'll need
          to remove your trousers. did you order twenty cases of... ripped
          pants?!.
